# Three tasks for DevOps job interview

## Groovy
Write a pipeline from scratch that will do the following:

Trigger from SCM change -> build an artifact -> pack the artifact and upload to repo.

Please use Groovy Shared-Libraries and create a function called prepareEnv. This function should be able to pass SCM trigger parameters into the groovy pipeline (for example, who was the code committer in the SCM).

## Bash
Write a bash script called extract which can unpack multiple packed files, and even traverse folders recursively and unpack all archives in them - regardless of the specific algorithm that was used when packing them. Following is the exact synopsis: extract [-h] [-r] [-v] file [file...]
Given a list of filenames as input, this script queries each target file (parsing the output of the file command) for the type of compression used on it. Then the script automatically invokes the appropriate decompression command, putting files in the same folder. If files with the same name already exist, they are overwritten.

Unpack should support 4 unpacking options - `gunzip`, `bunzip2`, `unzip`, `uncompress`.

Adding more options should be VERY simple.

Note that file names and extensions have no meaning - the only way to know what method to use is through the file command!

If a target file is not compressed, the script takes no other action on that particular file.

If the target is a directory then it decompresses all files in it using same method.

Command echos number of archives decompressed.

Command returns number of files it did NOT decompress.

Additional switches:

`-v` - verbose - echo each file decompressed & warn for each file that was NOT decompressed.

`-r` - recursive - will traverse contents of folders recursively, performing unpack on each.

`-h` - Should receive a HELP notice.

## Ansible and Docker
Create an ansible playbook that will deploy a docker-compose application containing two services:

1.	Web server that will offer a basic "Hello World" HTML page.
2.	Stateful service that will keep a counter-hit from the web server in a separate DB container.
